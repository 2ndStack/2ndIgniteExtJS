Ion Auth

Simple and Lightweight Auth System 
based on Redux Auth 2  
(but much better of course)

======================================

Hey everybody,

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean, 
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.

So I've refactored the code and added new methods and functions with the much 
appreciated help of Phil Sturgeon.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation is located at http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the files from this package to the correspoding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy Ion_auth/config/ion_auth.php to 
system/application/config/ion_auth.php. 

USING THE LIBRARY:   
In the package you will find example usage code in the controllers and views 
folders.  The example code isn't the most beautiful code you'll ever see but 
it'll show you how to use the library and it's nice and generic so it doesn't 
require a MY_controller or anything but it will be easy to add render() methods 
if needed since there is only one load->view() per controller method.

DEFAULT LOGIN:
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password    


IMPORTANT:   
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


OPTIMIZATION:
It is recommended that you add your identity column as an index.



Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.
